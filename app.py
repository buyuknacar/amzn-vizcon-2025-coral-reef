## The Crisis Beneath the Waves

When trying to understand the topic of sustainability, the impact that humans have on the environment is an extremely broad and significant area of discussion. But, there is **no better example** of human impact on the environment than the negative impacts humans have had on coral reefs around the world.

Coral reefs are some of the most biologically diverse and productive ecosystemsâ€”home to a wide array of symbiotic species that create some of the most beautiful living architecture on Earth.

st.info("An estimated **25% of all marine life**, including over 4,000 species of fish, are dependent on coral reefs at some point in their life cycle. **- *U.S. Environmental Protection Agency***")

st.markdown("""
### The Bleaching Crisis

However, coral reefs around the world have been significantly affected by the rise of global temperatures, changes in the climate, and general pollution of the environment and our oceansâ€”undergoing a transformation known as **coral bleaching**.

Coral bleaching occurs when corals become stressed by changes in their environment, most commonly:
-  **Elevated sea temperatures**
-  **Increased UV radiation**
-  **Poor water quality and pollution**

During bleaching, corals become transparentâ€”revealing their white skeletons. While bleached corals are still alive, they are significantly weakened and more vulnerable to starvation, disease, and even death.

st.warning(" **The Ripple Effect**: When reefs die, fish populations decline, marine food webs collapse, coastal communities lose tourism income, and natural storm protection weakens.")
