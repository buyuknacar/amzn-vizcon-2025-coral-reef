## The Crisis Beneath the Waves

When trying to understand the topic of sustainability, the impact that humans have on the environment is an extremely broad and significant area of discussion. But, there is **no better example** of human impact on the environment than the negative impacts humans have had on coral reefs around the world.

Coral reefs are some of the most biologically diverse and productive ecosystemsâ€”home to a wide array of symbiotic species that create some of the most beautiful living architecture on Earth.

st.markdown("""
### The Bleaching Crisis

However, coral reefs around the world have been significantly affected by the rise of global temperatures, changes in the climate, and general pollution of the environment and our oceansâ€”undergoing a transformation known as **coral bleaching**.

Coral bleaching occurs when corals become stressed by changes in their environment, most commonly:
-  **Elevated sea temperatures**
-  **Increased UV radiation**
-  **Poor water quality and pollution**

During bleaching, corals become transparentâ€”revealing their white skeletons. While bleached corals are still alive, they are significantly weakened and more vulnerable to starvation, disease, and even death.

## Conclusion

As we analyze the patterns of recovery and decline in places like the Great Barrier Reef, we learn so much about the resilience of nature and our role in protecting it. Coral bleaching can't be stopped entirely, but we can reduce its impact by cutting emissions, limiting local stressors like pollution, and supporting reef restoration efforts. Protecting coral reefs also means reducing coastal runoff, establishing marine protected areas, and investing in research that helps corals adapt to rising temperatures. 

While reefs have shown the ability to recover in the past, the combination of rising temperatures, pollution in the oceans, and more frequent extreme weather events is testing their ability to survive. Analyzing this data isn't just about documenting decline, it's about finding ways to protect and preserve these ecosystems for future generations.
