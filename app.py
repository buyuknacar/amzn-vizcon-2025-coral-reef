    ## The Crisis Beneath the Waves
    
    When trying to understand the topic of sustainability, the impact that humans have on the environment is an extremely broad and significant area of discussion. But, there is **no better example** of human impact on the environment than the negative impacts humans have had on coral reefs around the world.
    
    Coral reefs are some of the most biologically diverse and productive ecosystems‚Äîhome to a wide array of symbiotic species that create some of the most beautiful living architecture on Earth.

    ### The Bleaching Crisis
    
    However, coral reefs around the world have been significantly affected by the rise of global temperatures, changes in the climate, and general pollution of the environment and our oceans‚Äîundergoing a transformation known as **coral bleaching**.
    
    Coral bleaching occurs when corals become stressed by changes in their environment, most commonly:
    -  **Elevated sea temperatures**
    -  **Increased UV radiation**
    -  **Poor water quality and pollution**
    
    During bleaching, corals become transparent‚Äîrevealing their white skeletons. While bleached corals are still alive, they are significantly weakened and more vulnerable to starvation, disease, and even death.

    The Great Barrier Reef has become the global poster child for this crisis. As the world's largest reef system, its recent history of severe bleaching events has shocked scientists and sparked worldwide concern about the future of coral ecosystems.
